# CSS Grid Visualizer

### Created with React and Bulma

This project is a first attempt at using React.js and Bulma.
The goal of this project was to get acquainted with React structure and JSX in a real-life example while creating a useful tool.

This is also the first time I've used Sass in a project.

Project is sort of a running work in progress, although the core functionality is for the most part finished.
